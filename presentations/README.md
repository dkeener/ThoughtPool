Ruby Talks
----------

* [A Tour of Ruby] (https://github.com/dkeener/ThoughtPool/blob/master/presentations/Ruby_on_Rails.pdf?raw=true) - Since its public unveiling in 2004, Ruby on
Rails has taken the web development world by storm. Rails is an open-source
framework, built using the Ruby programming language, that promotes high
productivity and reduced development times for real-world web sites. This talk
will provide a high-level tour of the features of Ruby on Rails. It will also
show how this technology is being leveraged to create on-line businesses and
web sites. You don't have to be a programmer to learn more about how Ruby on Rails can power your on-line business.

* [Creating a World-Class RESTful Web Services API] (https://github.com/dkeener/ThoughtPool/blob/master/presentations/Creating_RESTful_API.pdf?raw=true) -
Companies like Amazon, Google and Yahoo have published web services API's that
empower developers to create mash-ups, add-ons and full-scale applications. The
creation of such API's, however, is not exclusively the domain of large,
multi-national corporations. Learn how to architect, build and field a
well-designed and scalable RESTful web services API that will allow your
business to leverage the capabilities of the developer community. This
presentation includes real-life examples from the Grab Networks RESTful API,
which provides access to information about the hundreds of thousands of news
videos available through Grab Networks' distribution network.
