* [A Tour of Ruby] (https://github.com/dkeener/ThoughtPool/blob/master/presentations/Ruby_on_Rails.pdf?raw=true) - Since its public unveiling in 2004, Ruby on
Rails has taken the web development world by storm. Rails is an open-source
framework, built using the Ruby programming language, that promotes high
productivity and reduced development times for real-world web sites. This talk
will provide a high-level tour of the features of Ruby on Rails. It will also
show how this technology is being leveraged to create on-line businesses and
web sites. You don't have to be a programmer to learn more about how Ruby on Rails can power your on-line business.
