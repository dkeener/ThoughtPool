These presentations cover a variety of technical topics in the web development
realm. They have been delivered in a wide range of settings, including
educational "brown bag" lunches, lightning talks, user groups and conferences.

Ruby Talks
----------

* [A Tour of Ruby] (https://github.com/dkeener/ThoughtPool/blob/master/presentations/Ruby_on_Rails.pdf?raw=true) - Since its public unveiling in 2004, Ruby on
Rails has taken the web development world by storm. Rails is an open-source
framework, built using the Ruby programming language, that promotes high
productivity and reduced development times for real-world web sites. This talk
will provide a high-level tour of the features of Ruby on Rails. It will also
show how this technology is being leveraged to create on-line businesses and
web sites. You don't have to be a programmer to learn more about how Ruby on
Rails can power your on-line business.

* [Creating a World-Class RESTful Web Services API] (https://github.com/dkeener/ThoughtPool/blob/master/presentations/Creating_RESTful_API.pdf?raw=true) -
Companies like Amazon, Google and Yahoo have published web services API's that
empower developers to create mash-ups, add-ons and full-scale applications. The
creation of such API's, however, is not exclusively the domain of large,
multi-national corporations. Learn how to architect, build and field a
well-designed and scalable RESTful web services API that will allow your
business to leverage the capabilities of the developer community. This
presentation includes real-life examples from the Grab Networks RESTful API,
which provides access to information about the hundreds of thousands of news
videos available through Grab Networks' distribution network. Presented at
[RubyNation 2009] (http://www.rubynation.org/archive/2009/index.html).

* [Creating Custom Charts Using Ruby Vector Graphics] (https://github.com/dkeener/ThoughtPool/blob/master/presentations/Rails_RVG_Intro.pdf?raw=true) - RVG is
a drawing API modeled after the Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) standard. RVG
is bundled with RMagick, which is a Ruby interface to the ImageMagick library.
Learn how to use RVG to create custom charts that can be integrated directly
into web sites. The presentation provides a general introduction to RVG, then
illustrates the use of RVG in a web application that displays nearby stars in
a generated perspective diagram.

* [Implementing OpenID for Your Social Networking Web Site] (https://github.com/dkeener/ThoughtPool/blob/master/presentations/OpenID_and_Rails.pdf?raw=true) -
There are thousands of social networking sites, each with their own unique
sign-on systems. How many user names and passwords do you really want to
remember? Wouldn't it be nice if you could have a single sign-on that you could
use on all of the sites that you frequent? OpenID is an open-source,
decentralized sign-on technology that promises this and more. Find out how to
implement OpenID for a web site using Ruby on Rails.

* [Introduction to Ruby on Rails] (https://github.com/dkeener/ThoughtPool/blob/master/presentations/Introduction_to_Ruby_on_Rails.pdf?raw=true) - This
presentation provides a thorough introduction to Ruby on Rails and is
particularly useful for individuals who are completely unfamiliar with Rails.

* [Leveraging Rails to Build Facebook Apps] (https://github.com/dkeener/ThoughtPool/blob/master/presentations/Leveraging_Rails_and_Facebook_v2.pdf?raw=true) -
This presentation is a distillation of practical tactics that have been used
to create highly successful FaceBook applications using Rails, including
real-life systems like PollCast and Iran Voices. FaceBook is the world's
largest social network, with over 500 million members. Presented at
[RubyNation 2010] (http://www.rubynation.org/archive/2010/index.html) and
[SunnyConf 2010] (http://www.sunnyconf.com).
A slightly updated and generalized version of this presentation called
[Building Facebook Apps] (https://github.com/dkeener/ThoughtPool/blob/master/presentations/DevIgnition_Building_Facebook_Apps.pdf)
was given at [DevIgnition 2011] (http://www.devignition.com).
