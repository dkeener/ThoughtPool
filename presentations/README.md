Business Talks
--------------

* [Killer Business Models] (https://github.com/dkeener/ThoughtPool/blob/master/presentations/Killer_Business_Models.pdf?raw=true) -
You've created some really great software, but is it sufficient to form the
basis of a viable business? What's your business model? How can you describe
your business model and effectively communicate your vision to others? How can
other people evaluate your business model and determine whether your vision
and business strategies have merit? In this talk, I'll provide a conceptual
basis for defining, documenting and evaluating business models. I'll also use
real-world examples to show how these concepts can be effectively applied to
help build actual businesses. Presented at [RubyNation 2011] (http://www.rubynation.org).

Ruby Talks
----------

* [A Tour of Ruby] (https://github.com/dkeener/ThoughtPool/blob/master/presentations/Ruby_on_Rails.pdf?raw=true) - Since its public unveiling in 2004, Ruby on
Rails has taken the web development world by storm. Rails is an open-source
framework, built using the Ruby programming language, that promotes high
productivity and reduced development times for real-world web sites. This talk
will provide a high-level tour of the features of Ruby on Rails. It will also
show how this technology is being leveraged to create on-line businesses and
web sites. You don't have to be a programmer to learn more about how Ruby on
Rails can power your on-line business.

* [Creating a World-Class RESTful Web Services API] (https://github.com/dkeener/ThoughtPool/blob/master/presentations/Creating_RESTful_API.pdf?raw=true) -
Companies like Amazon, Google and Yahoo have published web services API's that
empower developers to create mash-ups, add-ons and full-scale applications. The
creation of such API's, however, is not exclusively the domain of large,
multi-national corporations. Learn how to architect, build and field a
well-designed and scalable RESTful web services API that will allow your
business to leverage the capabilities of the developer community. This
presentation includes real-life examples from the Grab Networks RESTful API,
which provides access to information about the hundreds of thousands of news
videos available through Grab Networks' distribution network. Presented at
[RubyNation 2009] (http://www.rubynation.org/archive/2009/index.html).

* [Creating Custom Charts Using Ruby Vector Graphics] (https://github.com/dkeener/ThoughtPool/blob/master/presentations/Rails_RVG_Intro.pdf?raw=true) - RVG is
a drawing API modeled after the Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) standard. RVG
is bundled with RMagick, which is a Ruby interface to the ImageMagick library.
Learn how to use RVG to create custom charts that can be integrated directly
into web sites. The presentation provides a general introduction to RVG, then
illustrates the use of RVG in a web application that displays nearby stars in
a generated perspective diagram.

* [Implementing OpenID for Your Social Networking Web Site] (https://github.com/dkeener/ThoughtPool/blob/master/presentations/OpenID_and_Rails.pdf?raw=true) -
There are thousands of social networking sites, each with their own unique
sign-on systems. How many user names and passwords do you really want to
remember? Wouldn't it be nice if you could have a single sign-on that you could
use on all of the sites that you frequent? OpenID is an open-source,
decentralized sign-on technology that promises this and more. Find out how to
implement OpenID for a web site using Ruby on Rails.

* [Introduction to Ruby on Rails] (https://github.com/dkeener/ThoughtPool/blob/master/presentations/Introduction_to_Ruby_on_Rails.pdf?raw=true) - This
presentation provides a thorough introduction to Ruby on Rails and is
particularly useful for individuals who are completely unfamiliar with Rails.

* [Leveraging Rails to Build Facebook Apps] (https://github.com/dkeener/ThoughtPool/blob/master/presentations/Leveraging_Rails_and_Facebook_v2.pdf?raw=true) -
This presentation is a distillation of practical tactics that have been used
to create highly successful FaceBook applications using Rails, including
real-life systems like PollCast and Iran Voices. FaceBook is the world's
largest social network, with over 500 million members. Presented at
[RubyNation 2010] (http://www.rubynation.org/archive/2010/index.html) and
[SunnyConf 2010] (http://www.sunnyconf.com).
A slightly updated and generalized version of this presentation called
[Building Facebook Apps] (https://github.com/dkeener/ThoughtPool/blob/master/presentations/DevIgnition_Building_Facebook_Apps.pdf?raw=true)
was given at [DevIgnition 2011] (http://www.devignition.com).

ways in which Rails applications can interact effectively with third-party Java
libraries. The presentation shows how developers can leverage JRuby to augment
Rails applications with the mature, third-party libraries that are widely
available in the Java world. Presented at
[RubyNation 2008](http://www.rubynation.org/archive/2008/index.html).

* [Rails Security] (https://github.com/dkeener/ThoughtPool/blob/master/presentations/Rails_Security.pdf?raw=true) - So, you think your web application is

Find out how well it works when creating internal, corporate web applications
that have to access multiple legacy databases.

Quick-Start Ruby Talks
----------------------

Quick Start Presentations are short, highly focused presentations designed to
quickly familiarize viewers with a single topic. These presentations are ideal
for time slots of 10 to 15 minutes. They have been successfully used as:
1) planned interstitial content within longer events, and 2) lightning talks.

* [Quick Start: ActiveScaffold] (https://github.com/dkeener/ThoughtPool/blob/master/presentations/QuickStart_ActiveScaffold.pdf?raw=true) -
ActiveScaffold is more than just a replacement for the default scaffold
functionality built into the Rails framework. The ActiveScaffold plugin
provides a simple way for developers to quickly and easily add sophisticated
data maintenance and data display features to web sites. Presented at the
Scotland on Rails Conference in 2009. Note that, as of January 1, 2012,
ActiveScaffold has not yet been completely ported to Rails 3.0 (which makes
using it somewhat problematic).

* [Quick Start: Rails] (https://github.com/dkeener/ThoughtPool/blob/master/presentations/QuickStart_Rails.pdf?raw=true) -
This presentation provides a brief, non-technical overview of Ruby on Rails,
suitable for both management and technical professionals. For an audience of
Rails "newbies", the focus of the presentation is just on educating viewers
about Rails. For a more experienced audience, the spin is typically on how the
audience can effectively educate others about Rails as a technology.

Java Talks
----------

* [Creating Dynamic Charts With JFreeChart] (https://github.com/dkeener/ThoughtPool/blob/master/presentations/JFreeChartIntro.pdf?raw=true) - This presentation
describes how to use JFreeChart, a Java open source charting library, to
dynamically create charts and seamlessly embed them within web pages.

* [Maven: Managing Software Projects for Repeatable Results] (https://github.com/dkeener/ThoughtPool/blob/master/presentations/Maven_Intro.pdf?raw=true) -
This presentation explores the features of Maven 2, a software build tool that
has achieved prominence in the Java development arena. Find out how Maven can
be leveraged to automate key project tasks.
