* [Group Speech Exercise] (https://github.com/dkeener/ThoughtPool/blob/master/docs/Group_Speech_Exercise.pdf?raw=true) -
This exercise breaks an audience up into teams of two or three people. Each group
selects a topic from a list, then creates/organizes a short 2-3 minute speech to
address the topic. Finally, each group selects one person to deliver the speech
to the full audience. Available in [PDF] (https://github.com/dkeener/ThoughtPool/blob/master/docs/Group_Speech_Exercise.pdf?raw=true) and [Microsoft Word] (https://github.com/dkeener/ThoughtPool/blob/master/docs/Group_Speech_Exercise.doc?raw=true).

* [Web Site Survey] (https://github.com/dkeener/ThoughtPool/blob/master/docs/web_site_survey.pdf?raw=true) -
This survey, now at version 1.4, is designed to elicit details from prospective
customers regarding web sites that they would like to build. Since it requires
some serious work on the part of potential customers, it is: 1) useful in
filtering out the non-serious, and 2) helpful in getting customers to focus on
their requirements by probing areas that they may not have thought about. It is
generally most useful for small to medium web site projects. Available in
[PDF] (https://github.com/dkeener/ThoughtPool/blob/master/docs/web_site_survey.pdf?raw=true) and [Microsoft Word] (https://github.com/dkeener/ThoughtPool/blob/master/docs/web_site_survey.doc?raw=true).
